#19. Vector Repetition and Order Sorting:
#   For the vector c(-2, 4, -6, 8, -10), describe how to repeat the vector itself three times and each of
#   its elements 5 times. Following this, how would you sort the resulting vector from smallest to
#   largest?

vec_19<-rep(c(-2, 4, -6, 8, -10),times=3,each=5)
sort(vec_19)
