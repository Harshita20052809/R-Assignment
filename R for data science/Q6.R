#6. Create and store a vector that contains the following, in this order:
#    i. A sequence of length 5 from 3 to 6 (inclusive)
     g<-seq(from=3,to=6,length.out=5)
     g
     
#    ii. A twofold repetition of the vector c(2,-5.1,-33)
      h<-rep(c(2,-5.1,-33),times=2)
      h
#    iii. The value 7/42 + 2
     i<- 7/42 + 2
     
     total_vec<-c(g,h,i)
